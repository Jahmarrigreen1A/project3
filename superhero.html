<p>Jahmarri lived his normal life, and was also a normal kid as much as possible in the bitterly cold and humid streets of Buffalo, New York. Where the weather Jahmarri would get good grades, go out, and also elected to train in martial arts and fencing. Until one day his sister got attacked walking home with some friends by some city thugs on her way home . What started out as him simply trying to get revenge turned into him becoming a hero and protecting his city. The goal for Jahmarri is to take out the leader of the crime organization called 3rd Street Mafia who has had control of his city for generations now. He's ready to go and had prior training, but Jahmarri doesn't have the correct material to take on a whole mob. So his uncle Malik, is and a long time friend of his deceased father helps build/make the materials he will need to take on the mafia. Jahmarri in revenge for his sister and city eventually takes out the Mafia boss. When Jahmarri thinks things are gonna cool down, and attempts to return back to as much of a normal life as a crime fighting high school student can. Jahmarri soon finds out through Malik after a simple late night crime stopping spree with Jahmarri that someone actually sent out a hit for his sister to get attacked. Taken back and surprised Jahmarri finds out that night from some city goons that it was the CEO Chris to distract the family while he tries to take the moms company. Jahmarri quickly and angrily confronts Chris who's already prepared for this battle with a group of thugs at his disposal, and a sword of his own after Jahmarri defeats Chris he sees that even though his plan and job was completed he has a new one in defending his city.</p>
