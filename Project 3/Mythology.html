<p>In the beginning there was a council of Gods and Goddesses who were in the heavens and saw the land before them was barren, and decided to give it life. On the first day the  God of Water added oceans, lakes, and rivers and saw it was a good day. On the next day the Goddess of nature made nature and all the wildlife for the certain type of environment like birds, horses, and bears. The God of life then made man, and then saw that man would be lonely and took one of his ribs and then made women and told them to bring forth future generations of people. After that the Gods and Goddesses then had a council to together make a temple where they put their commandments and rules for the future generations to follow the council of Gods and Goddesses made the temple a place of worship, and a place to go to them for need or offering.</p>
